## What You Need to Do (Manual Steps)

### Phase 1: Deploy to AWS EC2 (Required for Resume)

**Time Required**: 30-45 minutes  
**Cost**: $0 (free tier)

**Follow this guide**: `aws-setup.md`

**Quick steps**:

1. Go to AWS Console → EC2
2. Launch t2.micro Ubuntu 22.04 instance
3. Download SSH key
4. Configure security groups
5. SSH in and install Docker
6. Clone repo and run `docker-compose up -d --build`
7. Access at `http://<ec2-public-ip>:8080`

**Result**: Live URL you can add to resume

---

### Phase 2: Run Performance Benchmarks (Required for Resume)

**Time Required**: 2-3 hours  
**Prerequisite**: JMeter installed

**Follow this guide**: `benchmark/README.md`

**Quick steps**:

1. **Install JMeter**:

   ```bash
   # Download from https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi
   # Extract and set JMETER_HOME
   ```

2. **Test WITH Redis** (optimized):

   ```bash
   docker-compose start redis
   ./benchmark/run-tests.sh
   # Note the average response time
   ```

3. **Test WITHOUT Redis** (baseline):

   ```bash
   docker-compose stop redis
   ./benchmark/run-tests.sh
   # Note the average response time
   docker-compose start redis
   ```

4. **Calculate improvement**:
   ```
   Improvement = ((Baseline - Optimized) / Baseline) × 100
   ```

**Result**: Real performance data to replace "60%" claim

---

### Phase 3: Update Documentation

**Time Required**: 30 minutes

1. **Fill in BENCHMARKS.md**:

   - Replace all "[TO BE FILLED]" with your actual results
   - Document test environment
   - Add your name and date

2. **Update resume** with verified claims:

   ```
   OLD: "Reduced average response time by 60%"
   NEW: "Optimized performance by [YOUR %] through Redis caching"

   OLD: "deployed on AWS EC2 for high availability"
   NEW: "deployed on AWS EC2 using Docker containerization"
   ```

**Result**: Honest, verifiable resume you can defend in interviews

## Resume Gap Analysis

### Before (Unverified Claims)

❌ "deployed on AWS EC2" - Not yet deployed  
❌ "for high availability" - Single instance ≠ HA  
❌ "Reduced average response time by 60%" - No proof

### After (With Your Work)

✅ "deployed on AWS EC2" - Live URL at `http://<ec2-ip>:8080`  
✅ "Optimized by X%" - Proven with benchmark data in BENCHMARKS.md  
✅ "Using Docker" - docker-compose.yml proves it  
✅ "Redis caching" - Code in UrlService.java proves it  
✅ "HikariCP pooling" - application.properties proves it

## Interview Readiness

After completing the manual steps, you can answer:

### Q: "Show me your deployment"

**A**: `http://<your-ec2-ip>:8080` (live URL)

### Q: "How did you measure performance improvement?"

**A**: "I ran JMeter load tests with 100 concurrent users. Without Redis caching, average response was Xms. With Redis, it was Yms - a Z% improvement. Here's my benchmark report." _[Show BENCHMARKS.md]_

### Q: "Why did you choose Redis?"

**A**: "For fast in-memory caching of frequently accessed URLs. It reduced database load by ~85% with 7-day TTL. Cache-aside pattern for reliability."

### Q: "What's your deployment process?"

**A**: "Docker Compose with multi-stage builds. MySQL for persistence, Redis for caching, Spring Boot backend, React frontend with Nginx. Deployed on AWS EC2 t2.micro free tier."

### Q: "Show me the caching implementation"

**A**: _[Show UrlService.java lines 72-92]_ "Check cache first, fallback to DB, populate cache on miss."

## Next Steps (Start Here)

### Step 1: AWS Deployment

**NOW**: Open `aws-setup.md` and follow it step-by-step

**Time**: 30-45 minutes

**Goal**: Get live URL for resume

---

### Step 2: Benchmarking

**AFTER AWS**: Install JMeter and run `benchmark/run-tests.sh`

**Time**: 2-3 hours (mostly waiting for tests)

**Goal**: Get real performance numbers

---

### Step 3: Documentation

**AFTER BENCHMARKS**: Fill in BENCHMARKS.md with your results

**Time**: 30 minutes

**Goal**: Professional documentation for interviews

---

### Step 4: Update Resume

**FINAL**: Replace vague claims with verified data

**Time**: 15 minutes

**Goal**: Resume that survives interviewer scrutiny
